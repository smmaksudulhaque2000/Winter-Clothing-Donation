          The Children's Warmth
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          In a remote mountain village, winters are unforgiving. Children often
          wake up to frost-covered fields and icy winds piercing through their
          small homes. Among them was 9-year-old Rafi, a cheerful boy who loved
          to play football with his friends. However, the winter season forced
          him indoors as he didn’t have proper clothes to protect him from the
          cold.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          When our team arrived at the village with winter clothing, Rafi was
          among the first to run out, curious yet shy. As we handed him a bright
          red jacket, a pair of thick socks, and a warm beanie, his face lit up
          with joy. He immediately put them on, dancing around to show his
          friends. His laughter echoed through the village, spreading a sense
          of happiness among everyone.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Rafi’s mother, who had been silently watching, approached us and said,
          "You don’t know what this means for us. My son can now go to school
          without falling sick from the cold. He’s been smiling all day, and
          that’s the biggest gift you’ve given me."
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The warmth didn’t stop with Rafi. Soon, the entire group of children
          was seen running around the village, their new jackets bringing color
          and life to the frosty landscape. For these children, the donation
          wasn’t just about clothes—it was about reclaiming their childhood and
          embracing the joy of being carefree, even in the coldest of times.
